# Image alignment
Attempts to automatically align images of sequential, histochemically stained skeletal muscle sections from [Elson et al. (2002)](https://sci-hub.mksa.top/10.1016/s0960-8966(02)00047-0) using [openCV](https://opencv.org/).

## Attempts
1. [greybackground.md](./greybackground.md) tried to align two greyscale images with smooth, grey background. 

2. [brightend.md](./brightened.md) tried to align two brightened greyscale images with grey background.
